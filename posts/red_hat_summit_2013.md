I just got back from my first Red Hat Summit in Boston, MA. I learned a bunch about [OpenStack (RDO)](http://openstack.redhat.com/), [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), and a ton of other stuff. The talks on RHEL7 features, systemd, performance tuning the kernel and NUMA with <code>tuned</code>, filesystems, and LXC were really good and informative. Special shout out to the guys who did the performance and NUMA talk (Bill Gray, Larry Woorman, Jeremy Eder, D. John Shakshober); I think I learned more in those 2 hours than the rest of the whole summit. Excellent breakdowns of problems that could be encountered, and how to solve them.

I would definitely do this again. The summit had a really high production value, and was really well planned (except for the Pub Crawl). Next time I wish I could buddy up with someone from the same company though.
