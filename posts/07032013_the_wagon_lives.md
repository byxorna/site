I got the wagon started today! Its running on a base map, and its AFR is all over the place, and it is really rough, but it runs! This is the culmination of almost 2 years of work on this project, and __damn__ it feels good.

More videos will be coming later, once I get it on the road and tuned. I've got a ton more work on my plate, but this was a major step!
