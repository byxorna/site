I AutoX'ed today for the first time this season with FCSCC. I would have skipped to work on the wagon, but it was in the big lot, so I couldn't say no. This would give me a chance to stretch my WRX's legs, because the larger courses let me stay up in the rev range, and in boost.

I completed my personal goal of beating Mike, which I did on my 5th run. The 5th run at 56.230s was my fastest, which was a nice improvement over my initial time of 61.xx seconds. We got 6 runs in, with time for a bunch of fun runs as well. My times were good enough to net me 2nd in Street Modified. Unfortunately, the 240 Panda in 1st in my class was the [SCCA national champion in SM in 2012](http://www.scca.com/solo/content.cfm?cid=51057). If you want to watch the interesting videos, they are run 5 and 6. The fun run is a good watch as well.

* Run 1 - 61.xx
* Run 2 - 58.2
* Run 3 - 57.02
* Run 4 - 57.117
* Run 5 - __56.230__
* Run 6 - 56.8
* Fun run 1 in mikes STi: 57.8

I took one fun run in Mike's 06 STi, which was a blast. It really is very squirrelly; the throttle hits hard, turn-in is initially very bitey, but then washes out without any warning. Very intense, and very fun.
